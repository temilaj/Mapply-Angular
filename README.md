# Mapply Angular

I've got a pretty unfledged plan for this, I don't know what it's going to be yet, but let's hope it's cool.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm.
- Angular Cli

## Install npm packages

Install the npm packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
```

## Running the app

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
